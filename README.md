# Kredda App
## A Node based crediting app for creators

Because of my background as a creative professional, and in more recent years a hiring manager of creative staff, I've been thinking about a well known issue with the industry. As a hiring manager, your often evaluating a candidate based upon a portfolio of work that you usually have no way to verify their actual contribution.

And from the perspective of the candidate, you have no way to assure the hiring manager that you truly did what you say you did. Kredda is an application that I've been thinking about building for a while to address both of these issues.

#### What is it, and what will it be?
Kredda is being built to allow designers, artists, writers, and developers to request credit for their contributions to projects.


## Progress

Kredda is a work in progress currently in working prototype form. I hope to complete a production ready application by 2020.
